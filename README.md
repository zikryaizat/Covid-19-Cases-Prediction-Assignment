# Covid-19-Cases-Prediction-Assignment
**COVID-19 IN MALAYSIA**
The arrival of COVID-19 scared everyone in Malaysia and affected everything â€“ the economy, people's lives, and work. It caused a lot of problems, especially with jobs and money. Many businesses had to close, and lots of people lost their jobs. People felt really worried and stressed about getting sick and being isolated from others. Some people could work from home, but others had to keep going to work even if it was risky. COVID-19 showed us how important it is to have good healthcare and support for everyone when things get tough. Even though Malaysia tried to deal with the virus, it's been tough, and we're still feeling the effects of it.





**ABOUT PROJECT**
This project focuses on developing a predictive model using LSTM to forecast COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. It will employ two approaches: single-step prediction, which forecasts the next immediate case count, and multi-step prediction, forecasting several future time points. By analyzing historical COVID-19 data, training the LSTM model to recognize patterns, and evaluating its performance, the aim is to create a reliable tool for anticipating future case trends.





**Results**
The model produced MeanAbsolutePercentageError(MAPE) values of 0.3% for Single-Step and 0.4% for Multi-step model
